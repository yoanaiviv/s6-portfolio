            <h2>GeoGraphix</h2>
            <p>GeoGraphix is a <bg>documentational website</bg> for the design system of Geodan.</p>
            <p>This is an individual project that was made for <bg>Geodan</bg> as part of my internship. I did a throughout research about miscommunication regarding the design system in the company. I created a high-fidelity prototype using <bg>Figma</bg>.</p>
            <p>When compiling the application I used <bg>HTML5, CSS, Angular CLI and PrimeNG components</bg>. It was my first time using Angular CLI and also using premade component.I used this framework simply because the company is using it.</p>
