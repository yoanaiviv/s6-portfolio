            <h2>Hi there, I'm Yoana!</h2>
            <p>I'm a <bg>passionate designer</bg> with a love for vibrant and innovative designs, especially when it comes to sneakers. Currently, I'm immersed in the world of <bg>ICT Media Design</bg>, specializing in UX/UI. My journey doesn't stop there – I'm also gaining experience as a <bg>part-time UX/UI designer</bg> at Sogelink.</p>
            <p>My expertise extends to front-end development, where I use <bg>HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript</bg> (particularly Angular) to craft seamless user experiences. I thrive on challenges and approach each project with a blend of diligence and creativity. Whether it's brainstorming a new concept or refining an existing design, I'm always eager to push the boundaries and deliver solutions that captivate and delight users.</p>
            <p>When I'm not busy crafting digital experiences, you can find me <bg>exploring the intersection of technology and art</bg>, seeking inspiration in the world around me. Feel free to explore my portfolio and get in touch – I'm always up for new collaborations and opportunities to bring exciting ideas to life.</p>
