            <p>The website is a <bg>personal portfolio</bg> for a Dutch singer and music teacher from Tilburg.</p>
            <p>This is a group project that was made for <bg>Maaike Girardin</bg> as part of my studies. We created the prototype using <bg>Adobe XD</bg>. The website is one pager showing her work and songs.</p>
            <p>When compiling the application we used <bg>HTML5, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript</bg>.</p>
